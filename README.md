# Cucumber Selenium Automation Framework for Magento Mock Website

## Overview

This is an automation framework built using Cucumber, Selenium, and Java to automate e-commerce scenarios on the Magento mock website (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/). The framework allows registered users to search for a product, select product variants, add items to the shopping cart, and complete the checkout process. It provides a structured approach to web testing with dynamic XPath handling and data-driven testing from Excel spreadsheets.

## Features

- **Selenium WebDriver Integration:** Utilizes Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, enabling cross-browser and platform testing.
- **Cucumber BDD Support:** Follows Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles, allowing the creation of human-readable test scenarios.
- **Allure Reporting:** Generates informative test reports using Allure Reporting, providing insights into test execution and results.
- **Dynamic XPath Handling:** Offers reliable handling of dynamic XPath expressions for interacting with web elements.
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Performs data-driven testing by reading test data from Excel spreadsheets.
